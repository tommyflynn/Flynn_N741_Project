Overview & Motivation
=====================
- Overview and Motivation: Why did you undertake this particular project? What inspired you, what are your background and research interests that may have influenced your decision? 








As a ballpark, your proposal should be about 2-3 pages of text, along with shells of the tables and figures that you plan. You could even include some preliminary data acquisition / analysis steps.

After we receive your proposals we will find a time to meet with you to discuss your proposal and also to help guide you through the rest of the analysis.


Objectives
==========
- Project Objectives: What is the primary focal question that you are trying to answer? What would you like to learn and accomplish?
The purpose of this study is to test the accuracy of the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) as a metric used to predict patient needs. To test the accuracy of the ESI, this study uses radiofrequency identification (RFID) locating data that includes every interaction patients have with ED staff (nurses, techs, administrators, and providers) and the duration of each of those interactions. Using this data will require specific knowledge of the R statistical packages, network analysis, and data science. My learning objectives are to: 
- Use Github, R Studio, R Markdown, to clean, describe, analyze, and publish results from the identified database.
- Apply visualization tools to the data and results that create greater understanding of the research and significance.
- 

Data
====
- Data: from where and how are you acquiring your data? **Provide a link to your data source.**
- Data Wrangling: Do you anticipate that there will be extensive data cleaning / reshaping / extraction? Are there questions you will need to calculate in your data (e.g., perhaps you have height and weight, but not BMI)? How will you implement this particular data wrangling step?




Analysis Plan
=============
- Exploratory Analysis: Which methods / visualizations are you planning to use to explore your tidy dataset?
- Analysis: How are you planning to analyze your data?

- Schedule, keeping in mind the due dates listed above for the intermediate and final milestones, make a plan to meet these deadlines. Write these in terms of weekly tasks / goals.
